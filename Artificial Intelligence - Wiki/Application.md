## Applications of Artificial Intelligence 

  Artificial Intelligence (AI) has grown considerably since its creation in the 1950â€™s and its use of applications in our everyday life has expanded far and wide from simple video games to life saving medical diagnoses. Here we will dig a bit more into some of the few major applications of AI.

### Games

  One of the earliest applications of AI has been games. Scientists and programmers started using early AI to learn the basics of games like checkers or chess to play against other human players; with a surprisingly high win rate. Since the start of game AI, it has expanded its use to controlling robot players in simple games like poker to major video games like starcraft that learn as they play against a human player and adapt.

### Machine Learning

  AI has significantly helped with complex algorithms or compiling large amounts of data since being applied to machine learning algorithms. Programmers have been able to cut down processing time and code complexity with machine learning AI, which is constantly reviewing the algorithm and tweaking it to simplify the algorithm.

### Customer Service

  One application that may be seen as more bad than good is customer service. In recent years, customer service AI has grown to be more helpful and help cutout humans to provide 24/7 customer service. From speaking to you over the phone and listening to your problems, to chatting with you and providing different solutions, AI has been on route to taking over basic customer service that we had once known

### Medical

  AI applications in healthcare are often used for classification, to evaluate a CT sacn or to identify high-risk patients. As of now, AI is moving in and helping with the high-cost problem of dosing. One study[^1] suggested that AI can save 16 billion dollars in determining the right dosage for cancer patients by quickly sifting through 1000s of medical data from past patients with similar body types.
