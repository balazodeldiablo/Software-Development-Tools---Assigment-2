## Artificial Intelligence
#### Goals

In a article [^1] that I read it says there are 8 goals of Artificial Intelligence which are Develop problem solving ability, Incorporate knowledge representation, Facilitate lanning, Allow Continuous learning, Encourage social intelligence, Promote creativity, achieve general intelligence, promote synergy between humans and AI. So with these goals they are supposed to improve on these in the future.
## 1.Develop Problem Solving Ability
AI reasearch was focused on the development of problem solving puzzles that are supposed to resemble on how humans are supposed to solve them.
## 2.Incorporate Knowledge Representation
AI research revolves around the idea of both knoledge engineering and representation which its to show that they know what objects, relations, and concepts.
## 3.Facilitate Planning
Intelligence agents find a way to predict the future. With AI planning it determines courses of actions in the system to achieve it's goal with the use of data analysis, predictive analytics, and forecasting
## 4.Allow Continuous Learning
AI learning implies the abilities of algorithms to improve its knowledge of an AI program with observations and past experiences  
## 5.Encourage Social Intelligence
AI emotion is something that AI recognizes and interprets humans feelings and emotions. With computing they are able to read facial expressions, voice tones, and body language
## 6.Promote Creativity
AI promotes creativity and artificial thinking that helps humans complete tasks better. AI go through data and go through many options to create paths for us to progress.
## 7.Achieve General Intelligence
AI researchers want to develop machines with general AI capabilities that uses both cognitive skill and do tasks with better proficiency than humans.
## 8. Promote Synergy Between Humans and AI
Critical roles for AI is to develop synergy with humans so they could work together and enhance each other capabilites instead of just relying on one.
